  <!-- JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML. -->
<!-- JSON data is represented as key-value pairs, similar to how objects are structured in JavaScript. -->
